# GGD-API
Government Grant Disbursement API

A RESTful API to help decide on groups of people who are eligible for various upcoming government grants. 
These grants are disbursed based on certain criteria - like total household income, age, occupation, etc. The API can build up a list of recipients and which households qualify for it. 
For ease of definition, a household is defined by all the people living inside 1 physical housing unit.
